                <p>
                    My name is Ossama Abdein. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, 
                    But it didn't fit me. So when I wrote my first real line of code in my senior year of college, 
                    I've decided to become a software developer. I gave mobile development a try (iOS), but the browser really captured me. 
                    I'm totally concentrated on the Front-End right now, but I am sure I'll take a deep dive to explore the Back-End in the near future.
                    <br>Also, I love free writing and blogging, it helps me relieve stress, although writing itself is stressful most of the time. It's Complicated, isn't it? 
                    <br>Anyway, Welcome to my website and make yourself at home.
